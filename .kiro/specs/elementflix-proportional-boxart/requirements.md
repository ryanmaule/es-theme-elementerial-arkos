# Requirements Document - ElementFlix Automatic Box Art Optimization

## Introduction

This feature enhances the ElementFlix view in the Elementerial theme to automatically optimize the layout based on each system's typical box art aspect ratios. Currently, the ElementFlix view uses a fixed autoLayout value (3.5 1) for all systems, which works well for portrait-oriented box art (like NES, Genesis) but poorly for landscape-oriented games (like SNES, N64) or square box art (like PlayStation, Game Boy). This enhancement automatically adjusts the autoLayout value based on the current system being viewed, providing optimal display for each system's box art proportions without requiring any user configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing games in ElementFlix view, I want the layout to automatically optimize for each system's box art proportions, so that SNES games show wider thumbnails, Game Boy games show more compact thumbnails, and NES games use the current optimal layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing SNES games in ElementFlix view THEN the system SHALL use autoLayout 1.8 1 to accommodate wide landscape box art
2. WHEN viewing Game Boy games in ElementFlix view THEN the system SHALL use autoLayout 2.5 1 to accommodate square box art
3. WHEN viewing NES/Genesis games in ElementFlix view THEN the system SHALL use autoLayout 3.5 1 to accommodate portrait box art
4. WHEN viewing N64 games in ElementFlix view THEN the system SHALL use autoLayout 1.9 1 to accommodate medium landscape box art

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the layout optimization to happen automatically based on the system I'm browsing, so that I don't need to manually configure settings for each system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between different game systems THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the appropriate autoLayout value for that system's box art proportions
2. WHEN the automatic optimization is active THEN the system SHALL require no user configuration or manual setting changes
3. WHEN browsing any supported system THEN the system SHALL use mathematically calculated autoLayout values based on typical box art aspect ratios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the automatic layout optimization to work seamlessly with existing ElementFlix functionality, so that navigation, selection, and other features continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using automatic layout optimization THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing ElementFlix navigation functionality
2. WHEN selecting games with optimized layouts THEN the system SHALL properly highlight and focus selected items
3. WHEN using automatic optimization THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with all screen ratios (3:2, 4:3, 5:3, 1:1)
4. WHEN using automatic optimization THEN the system SHALL work with all existing theme color schemes and font sizes
5. WHEN using automatic optimization THEN the system SHALL work with EmulationStation's built-in GRID SIZE settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a theme maintainer, I want the automatic layout optimization to follow existing theme architecture patterns, so that it integrates seamlessly and remains maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing automatic optimization THEN the system SHALL use the existing system.theme variable pattern used elsewhere in the theme
2. WHEN adding automatic functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing box art styles
3. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to existing code structure
4. WHEN adding automatic support THEN the system SHALL follow the same conditional configuration patterns used elsewhere in the theme
5. WHEN adding new systems THEN the system SHALL allow easy addition of new autoLayout values by simply adding new conditional statements
