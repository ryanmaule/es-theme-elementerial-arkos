# Implementation Plan - ElementFlix Automatic Box Art Optimization

- [x] 1. Research and analyze EmulationStation grid system capabilities
  - Investigate EmulationStation documentation for grid layout options beyond autoLayout
  - Test different imageSizeMode configurations to understand behavior with aspect ratios
  - Determine if manual grid sizing or modified autoLayout approach is better
  - Document findings and recommend optimal technical approach
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 2. Calculate optimal autoLayout values for each system
  - Use provided box art aspect ratios to calculate mathematically optimal autoLayout values
  - Create mapping between EmulationStation system names and calculated autoLayout values
  - Document the calculation methodology and rationale for each value
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement system-based autoLayout configuration
  - Add conditional autoLayout statements based on system.theme variable
  - Implement autoLayout overrides for square systems (PSX, Game Boy, etc.)
  - Implement autoLayout overrides for wide landscape systems (SNES, TurboGrafx, etc.)
  - Implement autoLayout overrides for medium landscape systems (N64)
  - Keep default autoLayout for portrait systems (NES, Genesis, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Test automatic optimization with different systems
  - Test SNES system with autoLayout 1.8 1 for wide landscape box art
  - Test Game Boy systems with autoLayout 2.5 1 for square box art
  - Test N64 system with autoLayout 1.9 1 for medium landscape box art
  - Test NES/Genesis systems with default autoLayout 3.5 1 for portrait box art
  - Verify that switching between systems automatically applies correct layouts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1_

- [ ] 5. Test automatic optimization with different screen ratios
  - Test automatic optimization on 3:2 ratio (480x320)
  - Test automatic optimization on 4:3 ratio (640x480)
  - Test automatic optimization on 5:3 ratio (1920x1152)
  - Test automatic optimization on 1:1 ratio (720x720)
  - Verify that system-specific autoLayout values work correctly across all ratios
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Validate navigation and selection functionality
  - Test horizontal scrolling navigation with automatic layouts
  - Verify that game selection highlighting works correctly with system-optimized layouts
  - Test keyboard/controller navigation between games with different autoLayout values
  - Ensure selection focus indicators display properly on all optimized layouts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Test compatibility with EmulationStation's GRID SIZE settings
  - Test automatic optimization with various GRID SIZE settings (1x1, 2x1, 2x2, etc.)
  - Verify that system-specific autoLayout values work in conjunction with user-selected grid sizes
  - Ensure that both GRID SIZE and automatic optimization work together properly
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 4.2_

- [ ] 8. Test compatibility with existing theme features
  - Test automatic optimization with all 14 color schemes
  - Test automatic optimization with small, medium, and large font sizes
  - Verify compatibility with video playback and metadata display
  - Test with custom backgrounds and other theme customization options
  - Test with existing BoxArtStyle options (Cover, Fit, Stretch)
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.2_

- [ ] 9. Test with real game collections across multiple systems
  - Test SNES collection with wide landscape box art
  - Test Game Boy collection with square box art
  - Test NES collection with portrait box art
  - Test N64 collection with medium landscape box art
  - Test PlayStation collection with square jewel case box art
  - Verify automatic switching when navigating between different systems
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1_

- [ ] 10. Performance and edge case testing
  - Test automatic optimization with large game collections (100+ games)
  - Test with missing or corrupted thumbnail images
  - Test with systems not explicitly configured (should use default)
  - Verify smooth scrolling performance with optimized layouts
  - Test rapid switching between systems with different autoLayout values
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.5_

- [ ] 11. Documentation and final validation
  - Document the system-to-autoLayout mapping for future maintenance
  - Create before/after comparison screenshots showing improvements for each system type
  - Document how to add new systems to the automatic optimization
  - Perform final testing across all supported devices and configurations
  - Validate that all requirements have been met
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.1, 4.4, 4.5_
